Specifications Of Deliverables: 
1. You must design custom ATMEL controller-based board by yourself for this project. 
2. Simulation should be done on Proteus and also design PCB in the same software with linked 
schematic  
3. Robotic Base of any suitable structure can be bought from market (Acrylic with 2 or 4 
motors) 
4. Dual channel H bridges can be used as modules or can be customized and designed by 
you 
5. It should operate on battery for at least 20 Min (preferably you can use Li-Po/Li-Ion 
batteries with at least 2000mah capacity or you can use your own power supplies for 
powering the bot). 
6. Micro SD card module must be used to store the information for logging. 
7. IR, Ultrasonic, Color Sensors can be used to detect red colored Obstacle. 
8. On Embedded side we must use I/O, ADC, Timers, Interrupts, PWM in REHBER 
9. Brain. Robot should send data wirelessly to on a remote computer using wireless 
module. 
10. A report describing your effort Block diagram with pins /Algorithms/State machine, 
Schematics, component list, Bill of Material, Limitation, future works, references 
(Sample will be given) should be submitted on GCR along with individual video 
presentation that should include the video of your project following the line at the end of the 
presentation.
